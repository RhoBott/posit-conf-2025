## re: mentoring "bingo cards"

Credit to Scott and others from Tricia's team for this idea, which started as a somewhat sweet/snarky comment in a mentor training session and turned into a practical tool. 

The Academy mentor team use these as shortlists of *things to keep top of mind while mentoring* (central square: **background yourself and foreground leaners**); while the idea may seem trite, our team has found these very valuable. (Why bingo cards instead of a list? There's no reason this can't be fun...)
