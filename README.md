## re: mentoring "bingo cards"

Credit to Scott and others from Tricia's team for this idea, which started as a snarky joke but stuck as a practical tool. The Academy mentor team use these as shortlists of *things to keep top of mind while mentoring* (central square: **background yourself and foreground leaners**); while the idea may seem trite, our team has found these very valuable.
